# IITB_Proc
This is the VHDL inplementation of a 16 bit processor.

The processor has a 16 bit 8 register register file along with an asynchronous memory, an ALU, some temporary registers along with whatever else was required to implement the following instructions - ADD, ADZ, ADC, ADI, NDU, NDC, NDZ, LHI, LW, SW, LA, SA, BEQ, JAL and JLR.

The details about these instructions along with any other information one needs to understand this project is specified in Project-1-Multicycle-RISC-IITB.pdf.
